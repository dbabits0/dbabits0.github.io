        <p id="aboutus-text">Purr Care is a pet sitting service that combines our love for animals with the opportunity to provide an invaluable service to pet owners. 
                Our list of services includes dog walking, pet transportation, pet sitting and provides owners the option to have someone stop by to check on their furry friend or fish.<br>
                <span id="walk_1"><img src="images/walk_1.jpg" alt="logo" width="30%"></span> <!--inline img-->
                As pet ownership continues to rise, there is a demand for reliable, convenient, stress-free, secure, and safe pet care solutions. 
                Our service aims to fill this gap by connecting pet owners with trusted pet sitters and dog walkers in their local area. Every pet is safely provided for and insured under Purr Care.
                Once our user fills out the required information, they will be seamlessly connected to the network of individual contractors that have been vetted by our team here at Purr Care.<br>
                 If a contractor accept an order our client then receives a notification to continue forward with booking and payment. All animals legally owned under the state and by the client can be serviced.
                There are two payment options available through Purr Care; individual payment or premium subscription. 
                This discounted rate will be applied when booking in bulk. Contractors will receive a portion of the subscription rate to adjust towards their normal hourly pricing. 
                Otherwise, payment will be at a set hourly rate. However, based on individual circumstances of the pet and pet owner, these differentials could involve an increase of pricing. Clients can always decline the option of our subscription model and pay on a per diem basis.
